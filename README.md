     To get the optimised homework setting (in my opinion - don't do this if you don't like it)

     Copy [block-static-filters.txt](https://github.com/Fox595676/sssmegthread/blob/main/ublock-static-filters.txt) > `Settings icon in the extension` > `My Filters` > `Paste the text`

# 📘 Homework / Learning

The following table has a set of ways of cheating / efficiently doing homework etc.

Learning Platform | Hack / Help | Possible on school devices
----------------- | ----------- | --------------------------
🎆 [Seneca](app.senecalearning.com) | [SenecaAnswer](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/aacmadajiomocfofkfpfjdcbbgdlonkc) - fill in blanks for typing answers, make sure to double click the box and reload the page :) | Yes
🔷 [Bedrock](app.bedrocklearning.org) | [HTTP Request Blocker](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/eckpjmeijpoipmldfbckahppeonkoeko) - skips the speech sections, greatly improving work speed. Add these two to the list: `*://doestz6t6i0b1.cloudfront.net/blocks/audio/*` and `*://doestz6t6i0b1.cloudfront.net/site/audio/*` | Yes
⛄ [DRF M](drfrostmaths.com) | [DrCheat](https://github.com/JolTheGreat/DrCheat) [Untested] - need to download and NOT unzip then import into Chrome extensions with developer mode on; [DFM Answer Tool](https://github.com/Asad-K/DFM-Answer-Tool) [Untested] - python program | No
🧊 [Blooket](https://play.blooket.com/play) | [Blooket Hacks](https://github.com/therealgliz/blooket-hacks) - To use the Blooket hacks, find the hack you want (most likely [these ones](https://github.com/therealgliz/blooket-hacks/tree/main/gold) - the setPlayerGold doesn't function for now), copy all of the text, get [this extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/gamgadbdliolbhjdcfjjpjfjhgfnckbp), and paste the text into the bottom part, then `Save JS`.| Yes
